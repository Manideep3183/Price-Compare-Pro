# 📊 Analytics & Activity Tracking Implementation

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Activity Tracking System**
Comprehensive tracking of all user interactions:

#### **Tracked Events:**
- ✅ **Product Clicks** (`clicked_product`)
  - Product name, retailer, price, rating, recommendation
  - Whether it's the best deal
  
- ✅ **Retailer Link Visits** (`clicked_retailer_link`)
  - Product name, retailer, price, product URL
  - Whether it's the best deal

- ✅ **View More Expansions** (`expanded_view_more`)
  - Platform, total items, currently showing, additional items

- ✅ **View More Collapse** (`collapsed_view_more`)
  - Same data as expansion

### 2. **Backend API Endpoints** (Already Existed)
- `POST /api/v1/searches` - Save search queries
- `GET /api/v1/searches` - Get user's search history
- `POST /api/v1/activity` - Log activity events
- `GET /api/v1/activity` - Get user's activity history
- `GET /api/v1/profile` - Get user profile with stats

### 3. **Frontend Components Modified**

#### **ProductCard.tsx**
- Added `trackActivity()` on card click
- Added `trackActivity()` on "View on Retailer" button click
- Tracks product details, price, rating, and best deal status

#### **ViewMoreButton.tsx**
- Added `trackActivity()` on expand/collapse
- Tracks platform, total items, and items being shown
- Now accepts `platform` prop

#### **ResultsDisplay.tsx**
- Updated to pass `platform` prop to ViewMoreButton
- Enables platform-specific tracking

### 4. **Analytics Dashboard** (`/analytics`)
Complete analytics page with 4 tabs:

#### **Tab 1: Search History**
- List of all searches with query, result count, and timestamp
- Sorted by most recent first
- Shows up to 20 recent searches

- Email verification badge
- Total searches and activities count
- Recent search terms as badges

#### **Overview Stats** (Top of page)
Four stat cards showing:
1. **Total Searches** - with average results per search
2. **Product Clicks** - number of products explored
3. **Retailer Visits** - number of retailer links followed
4. **View More** - times user expanded results

### 5. **Navigation Updates**

### 6. **API Client Functions** (`lib/api.ts`)
New functions added:
```typescript

getUserActivity(limit, eventType)  // Get activity history
getUserProfile()                   // Get profile with stats
```
